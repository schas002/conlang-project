# Consonant clusters

For reference, the table of the unvoiced consonants and the corresponding voiced ones:

| Consonants | | | | | | |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:|
| Unvoiced | <big>Pp</big> | <big>Tt</big> | <big>Ss</big> | <big>Ff</big> | <big>&#x428;&#x448;</big> | <big>Kk</big> |
| Voiced | <big>Bb</big> | <big>Dd</big> | <big>Zz</big> | <big>Vv</big> | <big>Jj</big> | <big>Gg</big> |

A consonant cluster is a pair of consonants, with the following restrictions:

1. It is forbidden for both consonants to be the same.

2. It is forbidden for one consonant to be voiced and the other unvoiced. The sonorant consonants Ll, Mm, Nn and Rr are exempt from this restriction. As a result, `Bf` is forbidden, `Sd` is forbidden, too, but both `Fl` and `Vl` and both `Ls` and `Lz` are permitted.
