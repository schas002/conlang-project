# Morphology

## Letter groups

- **V** represents any one vowel, that is, `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` or `u`.

- **VV** represents either
  - a diphthong, that is, `ai`, `ei`, `oi` or `au`, or
  - a two-syllable vowel pair with a hyphen separating the vowels, that is,

```
a-a a-e a-i a-o a-u
e-a e-e e-i e-o e-u
i-a i-e i-i i-o i-u
o-a o-e o-i o-o o-u
u-a u-e u-i u-o u-u
```

- **C** represents any one consonant, that is, one in <code>bdfgjklmnp&#x448;rstvz</code>. Syllabic `l`, `m`, `n` and `r` always count as consonants for the purposes of this document.

- **CC** represents a consonant cluster. In brief, any consonant pair is permissible as a consonant cluster unless it either
  - contains two identical letters, or
  - contains both a voiced (excluding `l`, `m`, `n` and `r`) and an unvoiced consonant.
