# Morphology

## Letter groups

- **V** represents any one vowel, that is, `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` or `u`.

- **VV** represents either
  - a diphthong, that is, `ai`, `ei`, `oi` or `au`, or
  - a two-syllable vowel pair with a hyphen separating the vowels, that is,

```
a-a a-e a-i a-o a-u
e-a e-e e-i e-o e-u
i-a i-e i-i i-o i-u
o-a o-e o-i o-o o-u
u-a u-e u-i u-o u-u
```

- **C** represents any one consonant, that is, one in <code>bdfgjklmnp&#x448;rstvz</code>. Syllabic `l`, `m`, `n` and `r` always count as consonants for the purposes of this document.

- **CC** represents a consonant cluster. In brief, any consonant pair is permissible as a consonant cluster unless it either
  - contains two identical letters, or
  - contains both a voiced (excluding `l`, `m`, `n` and `r`) and an unvoiced consonant.

There are three basic parts of speech, called [Snene](#snene), the structure words corresponding to English `and`, `if`, `the`, `to`; ???, the content words corresponding to `come`, `red`, `doctor`, `freely`; and ???, the proper names corresponding to `James`, `Afghanistan` and `Pope John Paul II`.

## Snene

The first group of words are Snene, the structure words.

Standard snene occur in four forms defined by their word structure.

```
V      a e i o u
CV     ba de fi go ju
VV     au ei i-a o-u u-e
CVV    ki-a pei mi-o koi ku-u
```

A word consisting of three or more vowels in a row, or a single consonant followed by three or more vowels, is of snene form too, but is deemed experimental. Examples of experimental snene include `ka-e-i`, `sei-o` and `bi-o-u`.

Experimental words will not be assigned any standard meaning or usage to them by the language designers, and words and usages coined by speakers of the language will not appear in official dictionaries for the indefinite future.
